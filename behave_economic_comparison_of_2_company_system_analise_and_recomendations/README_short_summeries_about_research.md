# Practical Work №7: Applying Game Theory to Enterprise Analysis and Modelling in the Context of Behavioral Economics
## Summary of Findings
1. **Game theory is an effective analytical tool for strategic decision-making.**  
   For the municipal enterprise *Svitoh*, it helps identify conflicts of interest, cooperative opportunities, and predict competitors’ reactions, reducing managerial risks and improving forecasting accuracy.

2. **Mathematical tools of game theory enable optimal strategic modelling.**  
   Concepts such as Nash equilibrium, dominant strategies, mixed strategies, and cooperative games demonstrated how *Svitoh* can develop stable strategies, avoid price wars, and maintain profitability.

3. **Behavioral factors significantly influence strategic outcomes.**  
   Trust, fairness, social approval, and reputation modify purely rational strategies. Integrating behavioral economics with game theory allowed the modelling of realistic scenarios where emotional and ethical factors shape decisions.

4. **Classical game experiments highlight the benefits of long-term cooperation.**  
   Games like *Prisoner's Dilemma*, *Public Goods*, *Investment*, *Ultimatum*, and *Battle of the Sexes* showed that *Svitoh* performs best when adopting cooperative, transparent, and trust-based strategies that support reputation capital.

5. **Strategic market scenarios confirm the value of proactive behavior**
   The optimal strategy for *Svitoh* is proactive — anticipating the actions of competitors and clients rather than reacting to them after the fact. This requires systematic planning, flexible pricing, and a focus on sustainable development.
6. **A developed cooperation model showed stable cooperative equilibrium.**
   Modelling coordination between *Svitoh* and city structures (e.g., joint organization of fairs and exhibitions) demonstrated that coordination agreements and shared scheduling create a stable (S, S) equilibrium, reduce competition, and increase joint profitability.

## Recommendations for *Svitoh*
1. Use game theory in strategic planning — develop scenario models, identify equilibria, and explore cooperative strategies with competitors, clients, and suppliers.  
2. Implement behavioral mechanisms to encourage cooperation — transparent ratings, shared incentives, trust-based systems, and reputation tracking.  
3. Apply cooperative game principles to form alliances with other municipal or private enterprises in logistics, events, or urban development.  
4. Build a strategic market monitoring system using elements of gamified analysis and repeated-game modelling.  
5. Incorporate psychological factors in marketing — fair pricing, transparent communication, and trust-based customer engagement.  
6. Apply game-theoretic insights in HR policies — reward cooperative behavior and reduce defection through structured incentive systems.  
7. Strengthen behavioral economics integration in internal processes — motivation, conflict management, and customer service.

# Practical Work №8: Applying Behavioral Finance Theory to Enterprise Analysis and Modelling

## Overview

This work applies behavioral finance theory to the financial analysis and modelling of two enterprises operating in different economic environments:  
- **"Stolychnyi" Household Services Center (Ukraine)**  
- **Odda-Produkt (Norway)**  

The study combines traditional financial analysis with behavioral-finance insights to understand how psychological factors, biases, and managerial decision-making influence financial stability, profitability, and long-term development strategies. Seven analytical tasks were completed, including financial diagnostics, profitability assessment, financial safety evaluation, and bankruptcy risk modelling.

## Key Findings

### **Stolychnyi (Ukraine)**  
A company showing operational improvement but facing structural risks.

- **Assets & revenue dynamics:** Growth in total assets and net revenue; improved structure of current assets, increasing liquidity reserves.  
- **Profitability:** Improved gross profit and selected profitability ratios, but accumulated losses from previous years reduce financial resilience.  
- **Financial stability:** Acceptable autonomy and leverage, yet declining maneuverability and rising dependency on borrowed capital increase risk exposure.  
- **Bankruptcy probability:** Medium risk level — stable capitalization supports solvency, but long-term losses and asset contraction may jeopardize future financial stability.  

**Overall:** Signs of operational recovery, but requires cost optimization, liquidity reinforcement, and resolution of structural losses.

### **Odda-Produkt (Norway)**  
A stable, conservatively managed enterprise with strong financial safety.

- **Assets & revenue dynamics:** Moderate but steady growth in assets, revenue, and equity.  
- **Profitability:** Positive profitability indicators (ROA/ROE), demonstrating efficient asset utilization.  
- **Financial stability:** High capital autonomy, low leverage, controlled liabilities — largely due to municipal/institutional financing.  
- **Bankruptcy probability:** Low; the company maintains strong financial safety. Primary vulnerability — dependence on municipal budget decisions and rising labor costs.  

**Overall:** High stability with low financial risk; future focus needed on revenue diversification and cost control.
## Comparative Insights (Stolychnyi vs Odda-Produkt)
- **Stability:** Odda-Produkt is significantly more stable due to conservative management and institutional support; Stolychnyi is more exposed to macroeconomic shocks.  
- **Profitability:** Both improved profitability, but Stolychnyi’s historical losses weaken its financial buffer.  
- **Liquidity:** Stolychnyi shows declining liquidity maneuverability; Odda-Produkt maintains stable access to financial resources.  
- **Behavioral factors:**  
  - Ukrainian context: stronger impact of biases (risk aversion, crisis-driven emotional decisions).  
  - Norwegian context: more structured, rational, ESG-oriented decision-making.  
## Practical Recommendations
1. **Scenario-based financial planning:** Regular stress-testing (pessimistic/base/optimistic cash-flow and capital-need scenarios).  
2. **KPI and early-warning systems:** Automated monitoring of liquidity, margins, turnover ratios.  
3. **Behavioral-finance tools in management:**  
   - Rule-based financial decision frameworks  
   - Short checklists to reduce emotional bias  
   - Cost-discipline nudges and structured oversight  

Behavioral-finance integration improves the accuracy of traditional financial diagnostics and reduces strategic risks, especially in unstable environments (e.g., Ukraine). For stable enterprises (e.g., Norway), these tools help avoid overconfidence and maintain disciplined risk management.
