## Python & Data Analysis
**Skills**: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn) for data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation; exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns; advanced data visualization (scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, heatmaps) to generate insights; statistical analysis and hypothesis testing; and predictive modeling (linear regression, classification) for data-driven decision making. Applied to academic and real-world datasets, including salaries, student performance, customer purchases, and product analytics, to produce actionable insights and support reporting and strategic planning.
