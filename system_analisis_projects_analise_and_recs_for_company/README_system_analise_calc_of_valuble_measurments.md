This work analyzes discrete and continuous fuzzy sets, focusing on normality, subnormality, supports, intersections, unions, and level set decomposition. Sets A, B, C, and D were evaluated using multiple definitions for union and intersection, demonstrating both theoretical understanding and practical application. Level sets of A and B were decomposed to show gradual membership thresholds. An applied example illustrated how fuzzy expert estimates can complement limited probabilistic data for real-world decision-making, highlighting the usefulness of fuzzy logic in risk assessment and informed management decisions. These methods can help SoftServe model uncertain information, support expert-based decisions, and improve system analysis and project risk evaluation.

**Analytical & Strategic Tools:**
    - Fuzzy set theory (discrete and continuous)
    - Normality and subnormality determination
    - Support calculation
    - Intersection and union (min/max, bounded sum/product, algebraic product/sum)
    - Level set decomposition
    - Practical fuzzy modeling example for decision support
